This is a learning project that aims to practice working with promise and fetch request.
The server is provided by SoftUni in order to simulate in a real environment different types of requests.
To run a server in VSCode, you need to download the Server folder to your local machine. In the VSC terminal, enter the path to the server.js file on your local machine and type "node server.js" in the terminal.
