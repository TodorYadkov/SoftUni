                        Stay away from those people who try to disparage your
                        ambitions. Small minds will always do that, but great
                        minds will give you a feeling that you can become great
                        too.

                        Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of
                        self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to
                        become the best of which you are capable.

                        Teamwork is the ability to work together toward a common
                        vision. The ability to direct individual accomplishments
                        toward organizational objectives. It is the fuel that
                        allows common people to attain uncommon results.
                        Individual commitment to a group effortâ€”that is what
                        makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a
                        civilisation work.
