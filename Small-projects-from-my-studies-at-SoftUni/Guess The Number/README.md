Guess A Number is a game in which your opponent, "the computer" chooses a random number between "1 and 100" and your task is to guess this number. After each number you enter, the computer will give you a hint of whether the number is greater or less than the number you selected until you guess the correct number.When you guess it, you go to the next level and try to guess a number that is in a larger range of numbers.
