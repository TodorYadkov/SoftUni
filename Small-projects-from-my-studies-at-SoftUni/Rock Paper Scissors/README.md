This is my first attempt at making a little Rock - Paper - Scissors game.
It is part of my SoftUni training with JavaScript.

The game is console and the player's choice must be entered manually by specifying Rock or R, Paper or P, Scissors or S, regardless of whether it is in lowercase or uppercase.

You can play the game directly in your Web browser here:
